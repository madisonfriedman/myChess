This folder contains a working copy of the files required to run my chess engine through the gui.
Some of the files here are used, some are not, and I haven't gotten around to pruning those out or refactoring
the rest of the files so this represents a very bare bones repository with limited explanation. I didn't write
the code for readability as I was the only one who needed/wanted to interact with/understand the code. Furthermore
the overall structure of the engine was changing frequently as my understanding of the nuances of the problem evolved.
This made commenting everything a pain as I had to test mutiple combinations of various segments of the code in order
to find an optimal combination. Had I realized at the start of this project how complex the code would be I probably
would have opted to take advantage of git from the start. Lesson learned, I can assure you that my production code
doesn't look as messy as this does at the moment. I plan to refactor everything when I have completed updating and
tuning the heuristic.

In order to runmy chess engine locally you will need these files:

1. ChessBoardWithColumnsAndRows.java
2. bitBoardOperations.java
3. AIv2Tree.java
4. chessPics.png
5. and all of the comparator classes. 

File 1 contains the basic GUI and this file needs to be executed to initiate the GUI. Everything else is called
via interaction with the GUI. 
File 2 contains all of the bitboard operations I required.
File 3 contains the tree and node classes along with relevant functions. 
File 4 contains the images for the GUI
The File 5 classes are simple comparator classes used when sorting the branches during AB search.
